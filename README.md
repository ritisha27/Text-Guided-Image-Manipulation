# Text-Guided-Image-Manipulation
Text-guided image manipulation is an image editing technique that manipulates a given image according to the natural language text descriptions.

The implementation of the above problem is done using two different methodologies:

[^1]: StyleGAN + CLIP loss
[^2]: Diffusion + CLIP loss
Diffusion showed better results both qualitatively and quantitatively than StyleGAN.
